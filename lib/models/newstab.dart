Nepal’s Parliament on Sunday ratified the Millennium Challenge Corporation Nepal Compact, after weeks of haggling among the political parties.

Deliberations started on Sunday afternoon after the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP)—three partners in the Sher Bahadur Deuba government—earlier in the day agreed to vote in favour of the compact with an “interpretative declaration”.

With the passage of the compact, which had been in Parliament since July 2019, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has pulled off a coup, as he has not only managed to stick to the deadline of February 28 given to the United States, but also saved the coalition from breaking apart.
